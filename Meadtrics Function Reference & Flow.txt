Meadtrics – Function Reference & Flow

Entry Point
------------
window.onload → render()

The application initializes by calling render() after the window loads, populating both the sidebar and detail view from stored data.

render()
---------
Purpose:
Redraws both the sidebar and the main detail panel.

Calls:
- renderBatchList()
- renderDetail()

renderBatchList()
-----------------
Purpose:
Displays the sidebar list of mead batches, divided into “Active” and “Archived.”

Calls:
- fmt(date) → Formats start dates.
- calcABV(og, fg) → Estimates ABV for quick overview.
- formatFermentationDays(startDate) → Shows how long fermentation has been running.
- formatMaturityDays(bottledDate) → Shows age of bottled meads.
- save(state) → Persists changes when renaming or deleting batches.
- render() → Refreshes the full UI after updates.

Uses:
- el(tag, attrs, children) → Utility for dynamic element creation.

renderDetail()
--------------
Purpose:
Displays either the “New Batch” creation form or details for the currently selected batch.

Calls:
- newBatchForm() → When no batch is selected.
- When a batch is selected:
  - chartCard(batch)
  - sgFormCard(batch)
  - eventFormCard(batch)
  - ingredientsTable(batch)
  - eventsTable(batch)
  - drawChart(batch) → Renders fermentation chart.
  - save(state) and render() after edits or duplication.
  - openLabelMaker(batch) via the Label Maker button.

chartCard(batch)
----------------
Purpose:
Creates the “Gravity & ABV over Time” chart section with a toggle button.

Calls:
- render() → Re-renders detail view when toggling between SG and ABV mode.

sgFormCard(batch)
-----------------
Purpose:
Allows the user to add new Specific Gravity readings (and automatically logs them as events).

Calls:
- crypto.randomUUID() → Generates unique SG IDs.
- batch.sgReadings.push(...)
- batch.events.push(...)
- save(state)
- render() → Refreshes chart and event table.

Also references:
- calcABV(og, fg) indirectly via the chart update.

eventFormCard(batch)
--------------------
Purpose:
Adds general events or notes (e.g., “racked,” “bottled,” or “note”).

Calls:
- save(state)
- render()

Dynamic Behavior:
Automatically shows/hides the note text field depending on the selected event type.

eventsTable(batch)
------------------
Purpose:
Displays the event and note history for a batch.
Supports inline editing and deletion of events.

Calls:
- fmt(date)
- save(state)
- render()

Additional Behavior:
When an SG event is deleted, its corresponding reading is removed from batch.sgReadings.

ingredientsTable(batch)
------------------------
Purpose:
Displays and edits the list of ingredients.
Users can add, edit, or delete ingredient rows.

Calls:
- save(state)
- render()

newBatchForm()
--------------
Purpose:
Collects and initializes data for creating a new mead batch.

Calls:
- crypto.randomUUID()
- save(state)
- render()

drawChart(batch)
----------------
Purpose:
Draws a canvas line chart showing Specific Gravity or ABV progression over time.

Calls:
- calcABV(og, fg)
- Internal closure: renderBase() for redraw operations.

Event Handlers:
- onmousemove and onmouseleave for interactive tooltips.

Depends On:
- Global chartMode (“sg” or “abv”).
- batch.sgReadings and batch.og.

openLabelMaker(batch)
---------------------
Purpose:
Opens a modal window with a printable label for the selected batch.

Calls:
- Inline escapeHTML() for sanitizing text.
- window.print() for printing.
- Adds event listeners for modal close actions.

Utility Functions

Function | Description | Used By
--------- | ------------ | ---------
el(tag, attrs, children) | Creates DOM elements dynamically. | Used across all render and form functions.
$() | Shortcut for document.querySelector. | Used globally.
fmt(date) | Returns localized date string. | Sidebar, Events Table.
calcABV(og, fg) | Calculates ABV as (OG − FG) × 131.25. | Chart and sidebar display.
calcSugarBreak(og, fgTarget) | Calculates the 1/3 sugar break gravity point. | drawChart(batch) (for chart marker), sgFormCard(batch) (for sugar-break alert).
formatMaturityDays(date) | Converts bottled date to a human-readable age. | Sidebar.
formatFermentationDays(date) | Converts start date into “Fermenting for X days/weeks.” | Sidebar.
load() | Loads app data from localStorage. | On startup.
save(state) | Persists app data to localStorage. | After every edit.
render() | Redraws the entire interface. | Central refresh trigger.
